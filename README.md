<h1>Book Shop Page</h1>
<p>This is an e-commerce website for selling books.</p>
<p>The books which are fetched from a .json file can be filtered by their genre. The books can be added to the basket or removed from the basket. The quantity of a book in the basket can be decreased and increased as long as there is enough stock. The contents of the basket are stored in localStorage so that the basket persists even after the user closes the browser or restarts the computer.</p>
